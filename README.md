## 📌 Overview

This repository provides a Docker image for [MapProxy](https://mapproxy.org/) with Nginx, a powerful tile cache and web mapping service.  

⚠ **Note**: This Docker image is designed to run on **Azure App Service**. Do not use this image for any other public service without SSH modifications unless you are sure you want to!  

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Build the Docker Image  
```bash
docker build -t mapproxy-docker .
```

### Run the Docker Image  
```bash
docker run -p 80:80 -p 2222:2222 --name mapproxy mapproxy-docker
```
This will start the MapProxy service and expose it on port `80`. SSH will be available on port `2222`.

### Access the Application  
- Open a browser and navigate to:  
  👉 **`http://localhost`**  

- SSH into the container using:  
  ```bash
  ssh root@localhost -p 2222
  ```

### Configuration Files  
- The **MapProxy configuration files** are located in `/mapproxy/config`.  
- If no `.yaml` configuration file is found, one will be **created automatically** using `mapproxy-util`.
